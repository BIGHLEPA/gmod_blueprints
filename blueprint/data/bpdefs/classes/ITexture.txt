CLASS ITexture
{
	FUNC SHARED Download
	{
		DESC Invokes the generator of the texture. Reloads file based textures from disk and clears render target textures.
	}
	PURE SHARED GetColor
	{
		DESC Returns the color of the specified pixel, only works for textures created from PNG files.
		IN x, PN_Number, #The X coordinate.
		IN y, PN_Number, #The Y coordinate.
		OUT color, PN_Color, PNF_None, #The color of the pixel as a Color structure.
	}
	PURE SHARED GetMappingHeight
	{
		DESC Returns the true unmodified height of the texture.
		OUT height, PN_Number, #height
	}
	PURE SHARED GetMappingWidth
	{
		DESC Returns the true unmodified width of the texture.
		OUT width, PN_Number, #width
	}
	PURE SHARED GetName
	{
		DESC Returns the name of the texture, in most cases the path.
		OUT name, PN_String, #name
	}
	PURE SHARED Height
	{
		DESC Returns the modified height of the texture, this value may be affected by mipmapping and other factors.
		OUT height, PN_Number, #height
	}
	FUNC SHARED IsError
	{
		DESC Returns whenever the texture is valid. (i.e. was loaded successfully or not)
		OUT error, PN_Bool, #Whether the texture was loaded successfully or not.
	}
	FUNC SHARED IsErrorTexture
	{
		DESC Returns whenever the texture is the error texture (pink and black checkers).
		OUT error, PN_Bool, #Whether the texture is the error texture or not.
	}
	PURE SHARED Width
	{
		DESC Returns the modified width of the texture, this value may be affected by mipmapping and other factors.
		OUT width, PN_Number, #width
	}
